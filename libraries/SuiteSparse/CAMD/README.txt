CAMD:  a set of routines for permuting sparse matrices prior to
    factorization.  Includes a version in C, a version in Fortran, and a MATLAB
    mexFunction.

Requires UFconfig, in the ../UFconfig directory relative to this directory.

Quick start (Unix, or Windows with Cygwin):

    To compile, test, and install CAMD, you may wish to first configure the
    installation by editting the ../UFconfig/UFconfig.mk file.  Next, cd to
    this directory (CAMD) and type "make" (or "make lib" if you do not have
    MATLAB).  When done, type "make clean" to remove unused *.o files
    (keeps the compiled libraries and demo programs).  See the User Guide
    (Doc/CAMD_UserGuide.pdf), or ../UFconfig/UFconfig.mk for more details.

Quick start (for MATLAB users);

    To compile, test, and install the CAMD mexFunction, cd to the
    CAMD/MATLAB directory and type camd_make at the MATLAB prompt.

If you have MATLAB 7.2 or earlier and use "make mex", you must first edit
UFconfig/UFconfig.h to remove the "-largeArrayDims" option from the MEX command
(or just use camd_make.m inside MATLAB).

Refer to the User Guide (Doc/CAMD_UserGuide.pdf) for how to install
and use CAMD.

Description:

    CAMD is a set of routines for pre-ordering sparse matrices prior to Cholesky
    or LU factorization, using the approximate minimum degree ordering
    algorithm with optional ordering constraints.  Written in ANSI/ISO C with
    a MATLAB interface.
